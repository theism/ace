# LLO Onboarding

Send onboarding communications to LLOs who accepted the opportunity invitation.

## Process

1. **Read inputs from GDrive:**
   - Invite log: `ACE/<opp-name>/connect-setup/invites.md`
   - Training materials: `ACE/<opp-name>/training-materials/`
   - Opportunity details: `ACE/<opp-name>/connect-setup/opportunity.md`

2. **For each invited LLO, compose an onboarding email:**
   - From: Ace-AI@Dimagi.com
   - CC: CRISPR Admin Dimagi Google Group
   - Subject: "[Opportunity Name] — Welcome and Next Steps"
   - Body:
     - Welcome and opportunity overview
     - Links to training materials (GDrive links or attachments)
     - Step-by-step instructions for getting started
     - Timeline and expectations
     - How to ask questions (email Ace-AI@Dimagi.com — handled by OCS)
     - Contact info for escalation

3. **Send emails** (or draft for review).

4. **Log communications** to `ACE/<opp-name>/comms-log/onboarding-emails.md`.

## MCP Tools Used
- Google Drive: `drive_read_file`, `drive_create_file`, `drive_list_folder`

## Current Workaround
1. Generate the email content for each LLO
2. Write drafts to `ACE/<opp-name>/comms-log/onboarding-drafts/`
3. Ask the user to send the emails from Ace-AI@Dimagi.com
4. Update the comms log with send confirmation

## Mode Behavior
