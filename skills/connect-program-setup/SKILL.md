# Connect Program Setup

Create or select a Connect program for this opportunity.

## Process

1. **Read the IDD** from `ACE/<opp-name>/idd.md`.

2. **Check for existing programs** that match this opportunity's domain/scope.
   Use connect-labs MCP `list_solicitations` or similar to browse existing programs.

3. **Decide: reuse or create**
   - If an existing program fits, note the program ID
   - If not, create a new program with appropriate name, description, and config

4. **Write program details** to `ACE/<opp-name>/connect-setup/program.md`:
   - Program ID
   - Program name
   - Whether reused or newly created
   - Configuration details

## MCP Tools Used
- Google Drive: `drive_read_file`, `drive_create_file`
- Connect (connect-labs): existing solicitation tools for discovery
- Connect: `create_program` — **NOT YET BUILT** (CCC-301)

## Current Workaround
1. Read the IDD and determine program requirements
2. Ask the user: "Does an existing Connect program fit this opportunity, or should we create a new one?"
3. If new: provide the user with the recommended program name and configuration
4. Ask the user to create it in the Connect UI and provide the Program ID
5. Record the Program ID in the opportunity folder

## Mode Behavior
- **Auto:** Create program (or guide manual creation), proceed
- **Review:** Present program choice for approval
