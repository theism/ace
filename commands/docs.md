# /ace:docs

Generate the ACE playbook — a human-readable document that explains the full
CRISPR-Connect process, generated from the actual agent and skill definitions.

## Process

1. **Read all agent definitions** from `agents/`:
   - Extract: name, description, workflow steps, gate points

2. **Read all skill definitions** from `skills/*/SKILL.md`:
   - Extract: name, description, process steps, MCP tools used, mode behavior,
     current workarounds (if any)

3. **Read integration specs** from `playbook/integrations/`:
   - Extract: what's available, what's needed, manual workarounds

4. **Generate playbook** at `docs/generated/playbook.md` with sections:

   ```markdown
   # ACE Playbook — CRISPR-Connect Process
