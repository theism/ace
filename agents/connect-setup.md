### Step 1: Program Setup
Invoke the `connect-program-setup` skill.

### Step 2: Opportunity Setup

- Input: Program ID, IDD, app deployment details
- Output: Opportunity created with verification rules, delivery units, payment units
- Depends on: Step 1 (needs Program ID)

### Step 3: LLO Invitations
Invoke the `llo-invite` skill.
- Input: Opportunity ID, LLO preferences from IDD
- Output: LLO contacts identified and invited
- **Gate (review mode):** Present invite list for approval before sending
- Depends on: Step 2 (needs Opportunity ID)

`ACE/<opp-name>/connect-setup-summary.md`.
